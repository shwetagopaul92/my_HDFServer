#AWS Instance - HDF Server Setup

The public AMI that has the server running is : ami-4e77ac58

Launch an AWS Instance with this AMI. 

```{}

  source activate h5serv
  cd hdf5-json/h5serv/server/
  python app.py
 
```

This would start the HDF server running. 

Open a new terminal, launch the AWS instance again. 

```{}

  source activate h5serv 
  #to access data - use the python scripts in /scripts
  cd scripts/
  python testall.py
 
```
